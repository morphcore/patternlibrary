### What is it for?
This Pattern Library is a quick and easy to use tool, to initialize the design for responsive website projects in a very quick manner. The Pattern library provides you with a lot of frequently used patterns in webdesign. Ranging from supernice sliders to very boring tables.

The Pattern Library allows you to quickly mockup a website with all the needed contents or functionalities on it. After that you can quickly personalize the layouts to your or your clients needs. Changing the fonts, colors, and layout elements is a breeze.

The Pattern Library is „ugly on purpose“. We didn’t focus on fancy design, hey we even used Arial instead of Helvetica. Instead we focused on maximal freedom and supereasy personalization. Take a look onto the Symbols page, that was really all we needed.

### How can I personalize it?
The best part about The Pattern Library is, it can grow with your projects. Everytime you work on a new project, take some time, add new patterns to the library and become a supermassive design overlord. Basically The Pattern Library uses the standard „Library“ functionality of Craft. Just take a look at this website to learn how to update and manage the library in craft:

### How do I use it?
#### Initialize the Craft Library
Open the Craft Library drawer and click on „Import Library“ Then select the Folder „Pattern Library.library“ that came with this document.

#### Check out the awesome stuff
You now have access to all the patterns that came with this document. You can also find all the patterns in the respective folders and pages on the left hand side, right here in sketch.

#### Use the page „Site Templates“ to start
Go ahead. Just open the Page „Site Templates“ here in sketch and start dragging and dropping the patterns into the site.

### How is it structured?
All patterns and templates come in three different sizes Large (Desktop), Medium (Tablet) and Small (Smartphone). Alle sizes use a basic grid system for easy alignement. All patterns also come with predefined spacings. So you can just drag & drop them without worriyng about spacing. You can tweak it of course, if you want to. The Names of the patterns are constructed like this: Pattern Name - Viewport Size.
So for example „Medium Headline centered - Large“ is a Medium sized Headline for a large Viewport. You get the idea.

### How do I design with it?
You can easily redesign everything in The Pattern Library. There are three locations in the sketch file where you can change every design element.

#### First location The „Symbols“ Page
We used very few symbols to minimize the documents complexity.
Just change the symbols here, or on the go while designing.

#### Second location Shared Styles
Every design element in The Pattern Library uses a shared style. If you want to change the overall look of the design just adjust these styles and you’re already a huge step further to your goal.

#### Third location Text Styles
Every (nearly every, let’s be honest here) text in The Pattern Library uses a text style. Just adjust these styles, change the font and color, to build your needed look.
